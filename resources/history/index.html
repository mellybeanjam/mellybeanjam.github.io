          <p>TVCs have been around since the beginning of the tech industry</p>
<p>The 1992 Landmark Temp-Worker Microsoft Case</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1992, contract &amp; temporary workers at Microsoft filed a lawsuit against being misclassified as independent contractors despite being &ldquo;Perma-temps&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working full-time or more hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working alongside full-time employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite being labeled as temporary or seasonal workers, many Microsoft contractors were working for the company for many years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were essentially working full-time without benefits or the pay they were owed from Microsoft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This meant that the workers were held in perpetual contract roles, doing full-time work, but not receiving benefits like full-time workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courts ruled in favor of the contract &amp; temp workers finally in 2000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcome: Contract workers still treated as expendable workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all contract workers received a payout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract term caps prevents workers from becoming &lsquo;perma-temps&rsquo;, but means contract workers are forced to find new work every 2 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules on separation of contract workers and FTEs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract workers cannot receive direct feedback from their host employer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contractors don&rsquo;t qualify for the same benefits as FTEs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract workers still treated as &lsquo;2nd class citizens&rsquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rise of Contract Workers in Large Tech Companies and the Gig Economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shift to more contractors than FTEs at companies like Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gig workers classified as Independent Contractors or Freelancers rather than FTEs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Grubhub; jobs with little in ways of protections or compensation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale behind the rise:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For companies, it means a more efficient hiring/firing process for unneeded workers, and overall lower labor costs for companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to provide benefits, pensions, and comparable wages to contingent workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertised to workers as giving them more control and flexibility over the terms of their employment (e.g., flexible hours, better work-life balance, variable terms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workers are kept in low-wage, short-term, or at-will employment, while companies profit and create the conditions that drive more people into contract work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A report in 2010 predicted the rise of contract work and that by 2020, more than 40% of the workforce will be made up of contingent workers, and that traditional full-time jobs will be increasingly hard to find. [<a href="https://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf">link</a>] We are seeing this prediction come to pass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bootcamps</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can&rsquo;t talk about contracting without talking about the rise and role of tech and coding bootcamps. Bootcamps are short-term computer technology skill training programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are advertised to people who want higher wages and as a way of iIncreasing diversity in tech&rsquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bringing in people who don&rsquo;t have access to college degrees in tech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coded as: PoC, women, non-white males, non-traditional career paths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need for an &lsquo;expensive college degree&rsquo; to get a tech job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But bootcamps are a way for companies to train large numbers of lower-skilled tech labor. (See Deskilling). Many bootcamp graduates end up working in contract jobs rather than full-time jobs that go to college graduates.Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquisition of Bootcamps by Contract Agencies:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018, Adecco Group, one of the largest contracting agencies acquired General Assembly. [<a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/3/7/17086788/wework-acquisition-list-conductor-meetup-flatiron">Link</a>]. WeWork now owns The Flatiron School.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It establishes a Bootcamp-to-Contract pipeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a move to keep constrained people within a larger system of contract labor. Pay tuition for a bootcamp. Get offered jobs from agencies that own the bootcamps. The agency then takes a cut of your wage. In the end, all money goes to the same corporation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Temps, Vendors, Contractors Striking Back</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Microsoft bug testers unionize to get paid leave (April 2015)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uber drivers attempt to deliver a petition to Uber but a driver is tackled by a security guard (October 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Walkout Against Sexual Harassment involved contractors speaking out against differences in handing harassment cases between TVCs and FTEs (November 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google TVC Letter demanding equal treatment, protections, and pay (December 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook contractors demanding better wages and sick leave (December 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract workers at Google, Pittsburgh unionizing (September 2019)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[MORE CURRENT EVENTS HERE]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instacart drivers strike/walkout amid the Coronavirus crisis (March 2020)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2020 and On:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contract work is not going away anytime soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies cutting FTEs but keeping TVCs on, then expanding their TVC slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The global coronavirus crisis and financial crisis means increasing number of jobs are becoming contingent, and FTE positions are drying up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass layoffs of workers in the service industry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass layoffs of FTEs at tech companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful companies like Walmart and Amazon are expanding their contract labor force by the hundreds of thousands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the coronavirus and capitalism destabilizes the US economy, we can expect full-time positions in the tech industry to shrink, and see a huge spike of people entering contingent work.</p>
</li>
