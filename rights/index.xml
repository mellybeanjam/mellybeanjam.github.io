      <description>YOUR RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AT WORK
In most cases, joining together with your coworkers to improve your working conditions under your contracting company is your legally protected right under the National Labor Relations Act NLRA. However, certain types of employees (like Independent Contractors on a 1099) do not have these same protections.
To learn more about your workplace organizing right and who is covered, go to https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/rights/employee-rights and https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/faq/nlrb.

      <description>Why document?
Oftentimes, management will shirk accountability and it will come down to your word against theirs. Documenting what goes on in your workplace will help workers corroborate events and is one of the best ways to defend yourself if you think you may be worried about your job and your workplace (the other best way is when you co-workers have your back). Even if you’re not sure if your situation is precarious, it’s never too early to start.</description>

      <description>TRICKS THEY’LL PULL ON YOU There are a number of reasons behind why contracting is so lucrative for businesses. Some of these decisions are made behind the scenes, but many others are done face-to-face.
HOURS AND PAY Promising contracted employees a certain amount of compensation and then giving them less when it comes time to sign Try to tell you to work without claiming your hours because it will help you get an FTE position (this is wage theft) Placing a higher volume of work, a greater number of hours, and providing less pay to employees with H1B visas.</description>
